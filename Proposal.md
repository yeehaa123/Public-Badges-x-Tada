Public Badges x Tada
====================


## Context 

Ethical Values within Teams and Organizations

- For Internal Purposes
- For External Purposes

Tada and Public Badges have a few things in common:

- both initiatives consider values to be plural and contextual
- both see the adoption of these values as continuous processes 
  and not a project or a goal
- both are evidence based, this evidence can be either 'soft' or 
  'hard' depending on the aforementioned context

Differences are mostly in the scope and direction in which they tackle the problem:

- Tada currently primarily approaches this problem inside-out
- Public Badges works mostly outside-in for the moment

The inside-out dynamic is - and should remain - mostly manual

- No numerical score, but collectively defining your position on scale
- The problem space is complex and layered, and should be structured accordingly
 
The outside-in dynamic focuses on automating and measuring as much as possible

- Bottom-up approach
- Partial automation is better than no AND full automation
- The problem space is complex and layered, but should be presented as simple as possible

These two approaches could and should meet and complement one another


## Proposal

Develop a dashboard that: 

- visualizes the trajectory of internal value goals towards ones that can be externally communicated through badges (complex -> simple)

- visualizes the trajectory of externally requested value goals and their adoption (or rejection) within a team and/or organization
